## 🏃 Run the Application (Now!)

```bash
# Make sure you're in the project directory
cd /home/user/Desktop/Crop_Prediction/crop_prediction_app

# Activate virtual environment (if not already activated)
source crop_venv/bin/activate

# Start the development server
python manage.py runserver
```

Then open your browser to: **http://127.0.0.1:8000/**

## 📝 What Works Right Now

### ✅ Working Features:
- Django framework fully configured
- SQLite database (for development)
- Static files setup
- Admin panel (Django admin)
- Basic project structure

### ⏳ To Be Implemented:
- User registration/login pages
- Crop prediction form
- ML model integration
- Supabase integration
- All templates and views

---

## 🔧 Quick Commands

```bash
# Activate virtual environment
source crop_venv/bin/activate

# Run development server
python manage.py runserver

# Create superuser (for Django admin)
python manage.py createsuperuser

# Check for issues
python manage.py check

# Run migrations (if needed)
python manage.py migrate

# Collect static files
python manage.py collectstatic --noinput
```

## 🎓 Next Development Steps

### Option 1: Use Django Admin (Quick Test)
```bash
# Create superuser
python manage.py createsuperuser

# Start server
python manage.py runserver

# Visit: http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/
```

### Option 2: Add Landing Page
1. Create template: `apps/core/templates/core/landing.html`
2. Add HTML/CSS
3. Visit: http://127.0.0.1:8000/

### Option 3: Full Implementation
Follow `/DOCS/MASTER_PRD_FINAL.md` for:
- All screen templates
